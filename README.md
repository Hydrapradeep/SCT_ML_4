Custom Hand Gesture Recognition
This project implements an advanced hand gesture recognition system using computer vision and deep learning.
The model is trained to recognize custom hand gestures (defined by the user) from images or real-time webcam input.

Applications include:

Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)

Touchless control systems

Virtual Reality (VR) / Augmented Reality (AR)

Sign language recognition

Robotics control
